# doc-api
This is a document management API that allows users to manages documents, users and user roles. Each document has access rights and Admin roles can access all documents and none admins can only access public documents. Any role can publish a document and they define whether its public.

*NB* getting documents by role or date routes support limits to the the number of results they return, check the `search.spec.js` file for examples.
**NB** Make sure all tests pass before testing the api with POSTman.

## Models

Three models are defined: `Roles`, `Users` and `Documents`. `Roles` must have a unique title on their creation. A `User` must have a `Role` defined for them. The routes are defined under `server/models`.

## Testing

Testing is achieved through use of `superagent`, `mocha` and `chai` packages. `superagent` is used to make requests to the api and `mocha` is the testing framework test and `chai` is the exception library. They will both be installed when you run `npm install` and the tests will run when you run `npm test`.

## Express Routes

Api endpoints were created using `express` router. To access them on a http client, run `node index.js` on your terminal. The routes are defined under `server/routes`.

## Mongo Database

Ensure that you have installed `mongodb` locally. Before you go ahead to run the tests or work with the api, run `mongod` on a seperate tab on your terminal. The configuration for connection to the db on mongo is defined under `server\config\index.js`. Each time tests are run or the app is run, the database is dropped and seeded.
